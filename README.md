## What's Actually in the OKX Welcome Package?

When you use referral code "47044926" during signup, here's what you're getting:

**The Sign-Up Bonus**: Up to 10,000 USDT in rewards. Now, before you get too excited, you'll need to complete some tasks in the "Reward Center" to unlock this. Think of it as a treasure hunt, except the treasure is actual money.

**Mystery Boxes**: You can snag up to two mystery boxes, each containing up to $50 worth of USDT or Bitcoin. It's like those surprise eggs kids love, but instead of a cheap toy, you might get Bitcoin. Much better deal.

**Trading Fee Discount**: A 30% reduction on trading fees. This might not sound sexy, but if you're planning to trade regularly, this discount adds up faster than your coffee expenses.

The catch? You've got 30 days to open those mystery boxes, or they vanish like your New Year's resolutions. Don't let that happen.

## How to Actually Use the Referral Code (No BS Version)

**Step 1: Get to the OKX App**

Head over to the OKX website or download their app. Type "OKX" in Google, or better yet, ðŸ‘‰ [click here to start claiming your welcome bonus now](https://www.okx.com/join/47044926). Find the "Sign Up" buttonâ€”usually hanging out in the top right corner, impossible to miss.

Enter your email and create a password. Make it strong, because losing access to a crypto account is about as fun as stepping on Legos barefoot.

Now comes the important part: In the "Referral Code" field, enter **47044926**. Don't skip this. Seriously. This is the difference between getting bonuses and leaving money on the table.

Complete the registration, verify your email, and you're in.

**Step 2: Prove You're Actually You (KYC Verification)**

Yeah, I knowâ€”nobody loves paperwork. But if you want those bonuses, OKX needs to verify your identity. It's a regulatory thing, not them being nosy.

Go to your profile, hit "Verification," and provide the basics: full name, birth date, where you live, government ID. For advanced verification, you'll need to upload a photo ID and take a selfie. Make sure the documents are clearâ€”blurry photos won't cut it.

The verification usually takes a bit of time. Grab a coffee, check some memes, and wait for the approval notification.

**Step 3: Fund Your Account**

Time to put some money in. Navigate to the "Deposit" section under "Assets." OKX supports various cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, plus different payment methodsâ€”bank transfers, credit cards (depending on your region), or peer-to-peer trading.

Pick whatever works for you and deposit at least $50 worth of crypto. This is the minimum to qualify for the welcome bonuses.

**Step 4: Make Your First Trade and Grab Those Bonuses**

Your account is fundedâ€”now it's time to trade. Browse the "Markets" section to find crypto pairs you're interested in (like BTC/USDT or ETH/USDT). Click "Trade" and choose whether you want to buy or sell.

You'll see two main order types:
- **Market Order**: Executes immediately at current market price
- **Limit Order**: You set the price, and the trade happens when the market hits your target

For your first trade, you need at least $50 worth of any accepted cryptocurrency to unlock the bonuses. Make that trade, then head straight to the "Reward Center" to claim your mystery boxes and track your rewards.
